SKILL ASSESSMENT TASK
Community Debate Arena — Battle of Opinions
Build a debate platform where users can create and join discussions by taking a stance—either
Support or Oppose. Participants post arguments under their selected side, and others can vote on
the most compelling responses. The platform will track top debaters via a scoreboard and include
auto-moderation to prevent toxic content.
Core Features (Must Complete):

1. Debate Creation
   Authenticated users can create a debate topic with the following fields:
   ● Title
   ● Description
   ● Tags (e.g., tech, ethics)
   ● Category
   ● image/banner
   ● Debate duration selector (e.g., 1 hour, 12 hours, 24 hours)
2. Join a Debate
   ● Authenticated users can join a debate by selecting one side:
   ○ Support (in favor of the topic)
   ○ Oppose (against the topic)
   ● A user cannot join both sides in the same debate.
3. Argument Posting
   Users can post their arguments under their selected side. Each argument must display:
   ● Author info
   ● Timestamp
   ● Vote count
   ● Edit/delete option (allowed only within 5 minutes of posting)
4. Voting System
   Users can vote on others’ arguments:
   ● One vote per argument per user
   ● You may implement upvote/downvote logic or just a single “Vote” button

5. Debate Countdown and Auto-Close
   ● Each debate will have a countdown timer
   ● When time expires:
   ○ Posting arguments is disabled
   ○ Voting is disabled
   ○ The side with the highest total votes is marked as the winner
6. Scoreboard
   A public leaderboard showing:
   ● Username
   ● Total votes received across all arguments
   ● Number of debates participated in
   ● Filters: weekly / monthly / all-time
7. Auto-Moderation (Toxic Words)
   When a user submits an argument:
   ● Check for banned/inappropriate words (predefined list)
   ● Prevent submission if found, and show a warning
   // Example banned words list: ["stupid", "idiot", "dumb"];
   Bonus Features (Highly Recommended):
   ● Reply Timer: Once a user joins a side, they must post their first argument within 5 minutes
   ● Dark Mode: Add a dark/light mode toggle for better user experience
   ● Mobile-Optimized UI: Ensure responsiveness across all screen sizes
   ● Public Debate Sharing: Allow debates to be shared via public URLs
   ● Search Debates: Allow filtering debates by title, tag, or category; include sorting (e.g., most
   voted, newest, ending soon)
   ● Debate Summary Generator: Display a static or mock AI-generated summary of the final
   debate outcome
   Tech Stack Requirements:
   ● Next.js 15 with App Router
   ● Tailwind CSS
   ● NextAuth.js for authentication
   ● Zod + React Hook Form for form validation
   ● Bonus: Use framer-motion for smooth transitions and animations
